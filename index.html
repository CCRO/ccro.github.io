<p>We apologize that our website is temporarily unavailable as we are moving to our completely re-designed website.  We expect the new site will be available in mid to late August.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, just reach us directly - please do feel free to e-mail me with any questions or needs you may have from the CCRO.  I am happy to assist members with access to papers or schedules, and to speak with anyone interested in learning more about the CCRO organization.

I can be reached at:<br>

We are excited to bring our members the new improved website very soon!
